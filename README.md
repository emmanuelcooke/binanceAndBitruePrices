# binanceAndBitruePrices

Here is the challenge task.

The task is very simple.

Your task is to fetch crypto prices from 2 exchanges (binance and bitrue)?

12 cryptos are "SGB,XRP,LTC,XLM,DOGE,ADA,ALGO,BCH,DGB,BTC,ETH,FIL".

You need to build a simple backend endpoint and the backend endpoint should return the result.

The format value should look like this:
{"XRP":38010,"LTC":7484181,"XLM":8264,"DOGE":8748,"ADA":30386,"ALGO":21995,"BCH":10898158,"DGB":912,"BTC":1771929769,"ETH":129158483,"FIL":419152,"SGB":1167}

We multiply 10^5 to consider the price integer value.
For example, if the BTC price is 17719.29769, you should return 1771929769.

You donâ€™t need to send us source code until we process the payment.
Once you finish the work, please give us a backend endpoint to check.
For example https://10.10.10.10/getprice.
